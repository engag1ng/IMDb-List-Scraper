# IMDb-List-Scraper
Provides a basic python function for scraping titles from a public IMDb list.

The script uses [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for web-scraping and [selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/) to bypass 'lazy loading' and ensure full lists.

> [!NOTE]
> This only works on **public** lists. If a list is not public an empty list (array) will be returned.

Even though this only 40 lines of code and very simple I couldn't find anything that did something similar online. I hope it helps. Thank you, and enjoy!
