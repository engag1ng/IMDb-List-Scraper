# IMDb-List-Scraper
Provides a basic python function for scraping titles from a public IMDb list

## Usage
1. Copy the `scrape_list.py` file into your project.
2. Import the `scrapeList` function with the following command: `from scrape_list import scrapeList`
3. Use the function using the following command: `scrapeList(<link>)`

Even though this only 40 lines of code and very simple I couldn't find anything that did something similar online. I hope it helps. Thank you, and enjoy!
